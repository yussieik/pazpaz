## Design Philosophy for PazPaz

**Context**: PazPaz is a practice management web app for independent therapists (massage, physiotherapy, psychotherapy). Always read [docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md](../../docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md) before making design decisions.

**Core Design Principles:**

1. **Calm, Not Cluttered**
   - Interfaces should reduce stress, not add to it
   - Use white space generously to create breathing room
   - Avoid visual noise: every element must serve a purpose
   - Progressive disclosure: show advanced features only when needed
   - Soft color palette with clinical professionalism

2. **Keyboard-First Efficiency**
   - Design for therapists who prefer keyboard over mouse
   - Provide visible keyboard shortcuts for common actions
   - Ensure tab order follows logical workflow
   - Design focus states that are clear but not distracting
   - Support quick navigation between calendar, clients, and notes

3. **Speed & Responsiveness**
   - Design interfaces that feel instantaneous
   - Use optimistic updates: show changes immediately
   - Loading states should be unobtrusive (no full-page spinners for common actions)
   - Design skeleton screens that match final content layout
   - Minimize perceived latency through strategic animation

4. **Trustworthy & Professional**
   - Clean, modern aesthetic without being trendy
   - Professional color choices that inspire confidence
   - Clear typography that reduces reading fatigue
   - Consistent terminology that matches clinical language
   - Subtle animations that enhance, not distract

5. **Context-Aware & Intelligent**
   - Design defaults that match common workflows
   - Surface relevant information at the right time
   - Hide complexity until needed
   - Provide helpful hints without being patronizing
   - Learn from user patterns (future: suggest times, detect patterns)

## Specific Design Guidelines

**Calendar/Scheduling Interface:**
- Weekly view is primary; day and month views are secondary
- Time slots should be large enough to read appointment details
- Drag-and-drop should feel natural with clear visual feedback
- Conflict detection must be immediately visible
- Color-code appointments by status (scheduled, confirmed, completed, cancelled)
- Show client names prominently; additional details on hover/click

**Client Management:**
- List view with clear search/filter affordances
- Treatment history should be scannable at a glance
- Timeline visualization for longitudinal care tracking
- Quick actions (schedule, add note) accessible from list view
- Privacy-conscious: avoid exposing full names in URLs or window titles

**SOAP Session Notes:**
- Structured form with clear section labels (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan)
- Autosave with visible indicator (unobtrusive, not distracting)
- Support for file attachments (photos, documents)
- Draft state clearly distinguished from finalized notes
- Easy navigation between sections without scrolling

**Form Design:**
- Label fields clearly; avoid placeholder-only labels
- Use smart defaults to reduce typing
- Inline validation with helpful error messages
- Required fields clearly marked
- Multi-step forms show progress and allow backward navigation

**Error States & Feedback:**
- Errors should be specific and actionable (not "Something went wrong")
- Use color + iconography to convey severity (error, warning, info, success)
- Position errors close to relevant fields
- Provide recovery paths (retry, undo, contact support)
- Success confirmations should be brief and unobtrusive

**Empty States:**
- Friendly, not condescending tone
- Clear next action (create first appointment, add client, etc.)
- Use illustration or iconography to add warmth
- Provide onboarding hints for new users
- Avoid generic "No items" messages
