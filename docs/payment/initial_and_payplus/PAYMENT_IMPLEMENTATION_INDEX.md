# Payment System Implementation - Master Index

**Status:** Phase 0 Complete ✅ - Ready for Phase 1
**Created:** October 30, 2025
**Last Updated:** October 30, 2025

---

## Overview

This document serves as the master index for the payment system implementation. The payment feature is built using an **opt-in feature flag architecture** where payments are disabled by default and can be enabled per workspace via Settings.

**Total Estimated Duration:** 8-11 weeks (2-3 months)

---

## Implementation Phases

### **Phase 0: Foundation & Infrastructure** ✅ COMPLETE
**Duration:** 1 week (Completed October 30, 2025)
**File:** [`PAYMENT_PHASE_0_FOUNDATION.md`](./PAYMENT_PHASE_0_FOUNDATION.md)

**Goal:** Establish database schema and feature flag infrastructure (no payment functionality)

**Key Deliverables:**
- ✅ Database migration with payment tables and nullable fields (7530a2393547_add_payment_infrastructure)
- ✅ SQLAlchemy models (`PaymentTransaction`, updated `Workspace`, `Appointment`)
- ✅ Feature flag detection (`workspace.payments_enabled`, `PaymentFeatureChecker` utility)
- ✅ Basic API endpoint (`GET /api/v1/payments/config` returns workspace payment config)
- ✅ 43 comprehensive tests (unit, integration, migration tests) - ALL PASSING
- ✅ Complete documentation ([Payment Schema](./backend/database/PAYMENT_SCHEMA.md), [Payment Features Guide](./backend/payment_features.md))

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Database schema deployed (all payment fields NULL/default)
- ✅ Feature flag detection works (returns False for all workspaces)
- ✅ No UI changes (payments completely hidden)
- ✅ No payment processing implemented
- ✅ All tests passing

**Status:** Production-ready infrastructure. Phase 1 can begin.

## Risk Summary

### **Critical Risks & Mitigation**

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Low adoption (<40%) | Medium | High | Opt-in architecture, user interviews, marketing |
| Webhook delivery failures | Medium | High | Idempotency checks, polling fallback, 48h alerts |
| PayPlus API changes | Medium | High | Provider abstraction, Meshulam backup, integration tests |
| PHI exposure to providers | Low | Critical | Generic descriptions only, legal review, audits |
| Stripe BAA delays | Low | Medium | Start BAA process early (Week 1 of Phase 3) |
| PDF generation issues | Medium | Medium | WeasyPrint fallback to HTML, Docker testing early |
| Tax receipt non-compliance | Medium | High | Accountant consultation, GreenInvoice backup plan |

---

## Testing Strategy

### **Unit Testing**
- All payment providers (mock HTTP calls)
- Payment service business logic
- VAT calculation
- Currency conversions (cents ↔ USD, agorot ↔ ILS)
- Webhook signature verification
- Receipt PDF generation

### **Integration Testing**
- End-to-end payment flow (create request → webhook → status update)
- Workspace isolation (therapist A cannot access therapist B's payments)
- Email sending (payment requests, receipts)
- Provider switching (preserve historical data)

### **Manual Testing (Sandbox)**
- PayPlus sandbox: Create payment → complete → verify webhook
- Stripe test mode: Create payment → complete → verify webhook
- Meshulam sandbox: Create payment → complete → verify webhook
- Receipt generation: Verify PDF looks correct (Hebrew layout, VAT)
- Financial reports: Verify calculations match database
