# File Upload Security Audit - Executive Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-12
**Status:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL PASS
**Risk Level:** LOW-MEDIUM
**Production Ready:** YES (after addressing 2 medium-priority items)

---

## Quick Decision

**APPROVED for production deployment** with conditions:
1. ✅ Implement PDF metadata stripping (2-4 hours)
2. ✅ Document S3 credential management (30 minutes)

**Security Score: 8.5/10** (Excellent)

---

## Critical Findings

### Must Fix Before Production

**FINDING 1: PDF Metadata Not Sanitized** ⚠️ MEDIUM
- **Impact:** PHI leakage via PDF author/title fields
- **Fix Time:** 2-4 hours
- **HIPAA Risk:** Violates "minimum necessary" principle

**FINDING 2: MinIO Credentials Default Values** ⚠️ MEDIUM
- **Impact:** Development only (production uses AWS IAM)
- **Fix Time:** 30 minutes
- **Risk:** Weak defaults may be left unchanged

---

## What's Working Well ✅

### Strong Security Controls
✅ Triple file validation (MIME + extension + content)
✅ UUID-based filenames (prevents path traversal)
✅ EXIF metadata stripped from images (GPS, camera info)
✅ Workspace isolation enforced everywhere
✅ Rate limiting (10 uploads/minute per user)
✅ Audit logging for all operations
✅ 49 comprehensive tests (all passing)

### Attack Vectors Blocked
✅ Malicious file uploads (PHP disguised as JPG)
✅ Path traversal attacks (../../etc/passwd)
✅ Decompression bombs (50 megapixel limit)
✅ Cross-workspace access (404 for other workspaces)
✅ Expired presigned URLs (15-minute expiration)
✅ Unauthenticated uploads (JWT required)

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Before Production)
1. Implement PDF metadata stripping using PyPDF2
2. Add startup validation for S3 credentials

### Short-Term (Within 2 Weeks)
3. Enable S3 bucket versioning (protects against accidental deletion)
4. Add test for GPS coordinate removal verification

### Long-Term (Future Sprints)
5. Add circuit breaker to rate limiting (Redis failure handling)
6. Integrate malware scanning (ClamAV or AWS GuardDuty)

---

## HIPAA Compliance

**Status:** ✅ COMPLIANT (after fixing FINDING 1)

✅ Access Control - JWT authentication, workspace isolation
✅ Audit Controls - All operations logged
✅ Integrity Controls - File validation, S3 ETag
✅ Transmission Security - TLS, presigned URLs
⚠️ Minimum Necessary - PDF metadata needs stripping

---

## Test Coverage

**Total Tests:** 49 (all passing ✅)
**Coverage:** Excellent

- 17 upload tests
- 4 list tests
- 7 download tests
- 6 delete tests
- 5 integration tests
- 10 workspace isolation tests

---

## Next Steps

1. Implement PDF metadata stripping (file_sanitization.py)
2. Add test: `test_pdf_author_metadata_stripped()`
3. Document S3 credential generation in README
4. Re-run security tests
5. Deploy to production
