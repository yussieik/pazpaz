## Compliance Certification

### Certification Statement (Post-Implementation)

Once all Critical and High Priority fixes are implemented, PazPaz can certify:

```
HIPAA Compliance Certification for Google Calendar Integration

PazPaz certifies that the Google Calendar Client Notifications feature:

✅ Requires Business Associate Agreement between therapist and Google
✅ Obtains client consent before sending invitations
✅ Minimizes PHI shared with Google (client initials, city-only location)
✅ Excludes sensitive PHI (diagnoses, symptoms, treatment notes)
✅ Logs all PHI disclosures to third parties in audit trail
✅ Encrypts client email addresses at rest and in transit
✅ Provides training materials for therapists on HIPAA compliance
✅ Documents breach notification process
✅ Enables clients to revoke consent at any time

Therapists using this feature are responsible for:
- Obtaining Business Associate Agreement with Google Workspace
- Obtaining written client consent before sending invitations
- Configuring privacy settings to minimize PHI exposure
- Regularly reviewing and deleting old calendar events
- Notifying clients of breaches per HIPAA requirements

Certified By: [Legal Counsel Name]
Date: [Date after fixes implemented]
Next Review: [Annual review date]
```

---

## Conclusion

### Current Compliance Status: ❌ **NON-COMPLIANT**

The Google Calendar Client Notifications feature **CANNOT** be deployed to production in its current state due to critical HIPAA violations:

1. **No BAA verification** - Therapists may share PHI with Google without required agreement
2. **No client consent** - Invitations sent without authorization
3. **Excessive PHI exposure** - Violates minimum necessary standard
4. **No audit trail** - Cannot account for PHI disclosures to patients

### Path to Compliance:

Implement **Phase 1 Critical Fixes** (1-2 weeks):
- Remove therapist notes from events
- Add client consent mechanism
- Add BAA verification
- Add audit logging
- Remove emails from logs

**After Phase 1:** Feature can be deployed with strong warnings and limited to therapists who acknowledge compliance responsibilities.

**After Phase 2:** Feature is production-ready with comprehensive training and documentation.

**After Phase 3:** Feature meets all HIPAA best practices and provides excellent user experience.
