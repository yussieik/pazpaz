## Overview

The `audit_events` table provides a comprehensive, immutable audit trail for all Protected Health Information (PHI) access and modifications in PazPaz. This system is designed to meet HIPAA compliance requirements and support security monitoring.

**Implementation History:**
- Week 1, Day 2 (October 3, 2025): Initial implementation
  - See [Implementation Report](/docs/reports/implementations/audit-logging-week1-day2.md) for detailed migration information

### Key Features

- **Immutability**: Database triggers prevent UPDATE and DELETE operations
- **Workspace Scoping**: All events are scoped to a workspace for multi-tenancy
- **Flexible Metadata**: JSONB storage for additional context (NO PII/PHI)
- **High Performance**: Optimized indexes for common query patterns
- **PHI Access Tracking**: Dedicated partial index for HIPAA compliance

### HIPAA Requirements Addressed

✅ **45 CFR § 164.312(b)** - Audit Controls
✅ **45 CFR § 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(D)** - Information System Activity Review
✅ **45 CFR § 164.308(a)(5)(ii)(C)** - Log-in Monitoring

## Schema Design

### Table: `audit_events`

| Column | Type | Nullable | Description |
|--------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | UUID | NOT NULL | Primary key, auto-generated |
| `workspace_id` | UUID | NOT NULL | Foreign key to workspaces (ON DELETE CASCADE) |
| `user_id` | UUID | NULL | Foreign key to users (ON DELETE SET NULL, NULL for system events) |
| `event_type` | VARCHAR(100) | NOT NULL | Namespaced event type (e.g., `client.view`, `session.create`) |
| `resource_type` | VARCHAR(50) | NULL | Type of resource (User, Client, Session, etc.) |
| `resource_id` | UUID | NULL | ID of the resource accessed/modified |
| `action` | VARCHAR(20) | NOT NULL | Action performed (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.) |
| `ip_address` | VARCHAR(45) | NULL | Client IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) |
| `user_agent` | TEXT | NULL | User agent string from request |
| `metadata` | JSONB | NULL | Additional context (NO PII/PHI allowed) |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | NOT NULL | Event timestamp (server default: CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) |

### Constraints

- **Primary Key**: `id`
- **Foreign Keys**:
  - `workspace_id` → `workspaces.id` (ON DELETE CASCADE)
  - `user_id` → `users.id` (ON DELETE SET NULL)
- **Immutability Triggers**:
  - `prevent_audit_event_update`: Blocks UPDATE operations
  - `prevent_audit_event_delete`: Blocks DELETE operations

### Relationships

```python
# Workspace → AuditEvents (one-to-many, cascade delete)
workspace.audit_events

# User → AuditEvents (one-to-many, nullable on user delete)
user.audit_events
```

---

## Event Type Taxonomy

### Naming Convention

Event types use dot-notation namespacing:

```
{resource}.{action}[.{detail}]
```

**Examples**:
- `user.login`
- `client.create`
- `session.update`
- `appointment.delete`
- `phi.export`

```python
class AuditAction(str, enum.Enum):
    CREATE = "CREATE"   # Resource created
    READ = "READ"       # Resource accessed/viewed
    UPDATE = "UPDATE"   # Resource modified
    DELETE = "DELETE"   # Resource deleted
    LOGIN = "LOGIN"     # User authentication
    LOGOUT = "LOGOUT"   # User session end
    EXPORT = "EXPORT"   # Data exported
    PRINT = "PRINT"     # Data printed
    SHARE = "SHARE"     # Data shared
```

### Resource Type Enum Values

    PLAN_OF_CARE = "PlanOfCare"
    SERVICE = "Service"
    LOCATION = "Location"
    WORKSPACE = "Workspace"
```

---

## Indexing Strategy

### 1. Primary Timeline Index
**Name**: `ix_audit_events_workspace_created`
**Columns**: `(workspace_id, created_at DESC)`
**Use Case**: Timeline queries for workspace

```sql
-- Get all events for workspace in date range
SELECT * FROM audit_events
WHERE workspace_id = $1
  AND created_at >= $2
  AND created_at <= $3
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**Performance**: <50ms for 10,000+ events

---

### 2. User Activity Index
**Name**: `ix_audit_events_workspace_user`
**Columns**: `(workspace_id, user_id, created_at DESC)`
**Use Case**: User-specific audit queries

```sql
-- What did user X do in workspace Y?
SELECT * FROM audit_events
WHERE workspace_id = $1
  AND user_id = $2
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**Performance**: <100ms for user activity reports

---

### 3. Event Type Filter Index
**Name**: `ix_audit_events_workspace_event_type`
**Columns**: `(workspace_id, event_type, created_at DESC)`
**Use Case**: Filter by event category

```sql
-- All login events for workspace
SELECT * FROM audit_events
WHERE workspace_id = $1
  AND event_type LIKE 'user.login%'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**Performance**: <100ms for event type filtering

---

### 4. Resource Audit Trail Index
**Name**: `ix_audit_events_resource`
**Columns**: `(resource_type, resource_id, created_at DESC)`
**Use Case**: Resource-specific audit trail

```sql
-- Who accessed client X? What changed in session Y?
SELECT * FROM audit_events
WHERE resource_type = 'Client'
  AND resource_id = $1
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**Performance**: <100ms for resource history

---

### 5. PHI Access Tracking Index (HIPAA)
**Name**: `ix_audit_events_phi_access`
**Columns**: `(workspace_id, resource_type, created_at DESC)`
**Partial Index Where**: `action = 'READ' AND resource_type IN ('Client', 'Session', 'PlanOfCare')`
**Use Case**: Track all PHI access for compliance

```sql
-- All PHI READ operations in workspace
SELECT * FROM audit_events
WHERE workspace_id = $1
  AND action = 'READ'
  AND resource_type IN ('Client', 'Session', 'PlanOfCare')
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**Performance**: <50ms for PHI access reports
**Storage**: 50% smaller than full index (partial index optimization)

---

## Query Patterns

### Common Audit Queries

#### 1. Who accessed client X's data in the last 30 days?

```sql
SELECT
    ae.created_at,
    u.full_name as user_name,
    u.email as user_email,
    ae.event_type,
    ae.action,
    ae.ip_address,
    ae.metadata
FROM audit_events ae
LEFT JOIN users u ON ae.user_id = u.id
WHERE ae.resource_type = 'Client'
  AND ae.resource_id = :client_id
  AND ae.created_at >= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '30 days'
ORDER BY ae.created_at DESC;
```

**Index Used**: `ix_audit_events_resource`
**Expected Performance**: <100ms

---

#### 2. What changes were made to session Y?

```sql
SELECT
    ae.created_at,
    u.full_name as user_name,
    ae.action,
    ae.metadata->>'changed_fields' as changed_fields,
    ae.metadata->>'previous_values' as previous_values
FROM audit_events ae
LEFT JOIN users u ON ae.user_id = u.id
WHERE ae.resource_type = 'Session'
  AND ae.resource_id = :session_id
  AND ae.action IN ('CREATE', 'UPDATE', 'DELETE')
ORDER BY ae.created_at ASC;
```

**Index Used**: `ix_audit_events_resource`
**Expected Performance**: <100ms

---

#### 3. All login attempts for user Z

```sql
SELECT
    ae.created_at,
    ae.event_type,
    ae.ip_address,
    ae.user_agent,
    ae.metadata->>'success' as login_success
FROM audit_events ae
WHERE ae.user_id = :user_id
  AND ae.event_type LIKE 'user.login%'
ORDER BY ae.created_at DESC;
```

**Index Used**: `ix_audit_events_workspace_user`
**Expected Performance**: <100ms

---

#### 4. All PHI access events in workspace W

```sql
SELECT
    ae.created_at,
    u.full_name as user_name,
    ae.resource_type,
    ae.resource_id,
    ae.event_type,
    ae.ip_address
FROM audit_events ae
LEFT JOIN users u ON ae.user_id = u.id
WHERE ae.workspace_id = :workspace_id
  AND ae.action = 'READ'
  AND ae.resource_type IN ('Client', 'Session', 'PlanOfCare')
ORDER BY ae.created_at DESC;
```

**Index Used**: `ix_audit_events_phi_access` (partial index)
**Expected Performance**: <50ms

---

#### 5. Failed login attempts in last 24 hours

```sql
SELECT
    ae.created_at,
    ae.ip_address,
    ae.user_agent,
    ae.metadata->>'email_attempted' as email_attempted
FROM audit_events ae
WHERE ae.workspace_id = :workspace_id
  AND ae.event_type = 'user.login.failed'
  AND ae.created_at >= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '24 hours'
ORDER BY ae.created_at DESC;
```

**Index Used**: `ix_audit_events_workspace_event_type`
**Expected Performance**: <100ms

---

#### 6. User activity summary for date range

```sql
SELECT
    ae.event_type,
    COUNT(*) as event_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ae.user_id) as unique_users
FROM audit_events ae
WHERE ae.workspace_id = :workspace_id
  AND ae.created_at BETWEEN :start_date AND :end_date
GROUP BY ae.event_type
ORDER BY event_count DESC;
```

**Index Used**: `ix_audit_events_workspace_created`
**Expected Performance**: <200ms

---

### Metadata Field Examples

The `metadata` JSONB column stores additional context. **CRITICAL**: Never store PII/PHI in metadata.

#### Login Event Metadata
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "method": "magic_link",
    "2fa_used": false,
    "session_duration_minutes": 30
}
```

#### Client Update Metadata
```json
{
    "changed_fields": ["email", "phone"],
    "previous_values": {
        "email": "old@example.com",
        "phone": "+1234567890"
    }
}
```

#### Session Finalize Metadata
```json
{
    "draft_duration_minutes": 45,
    "attachments_count": 2,
    "word_count": 342
}
```

#### Export Event Metadata
```json
{
    "format": "PDF",
    "record_count": 1,
    "date_range": "2024-01-01 to 2024-12-31"
}
```

## Retention and Archival

### Default Retention Policy

**HIPAA Requirement**: Audit logs must be retained for **7 years** (45 CFR § 164.316(b)(2)(i))

### Retention Strategy

#### Active Storage (0-1 year)
- **Location**: Primary PostgreSQL database
- **Performance**: Full query performance with all indexes
- **Access**: Real-time queries via application

#### Warm Storage (1-3 years)
- **Location**: Partitioned tables in PostgreSQL
- **Performance**: Slightly slower queries (still indexed)
- **Access**: Available for compliance queries

#### Cold Storage (3-7 years)
- **Location**: Archived to S3/MinIO with Parquet format
- **Performance**: Batch queries only (not real-time)
- **Access**: Manual retrieval for legal/compliance requests

### Partitioning Strategy (Production)

Partition by month for performance and archival:

```sql
-- Create partitioned table (future enhancement)
CREATE TABLE audit_events (
    -- same schema as above
) PARTITION BY RANGE (created_at);

-- Monthly partitions
CREATE TABLE audit_events_2024_01 PARTITION OF audit_events
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-02-01');

CREATE TABLE audit_events_2024_02 PARTITION OF audit_events
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-02-01') TO ('2024-03-01');
```

**Benefits**:
- Drop old partitions without locking
- Faster queries on recent data
- Simplified archival process

### Archival Procedure

```python
# Pseudocode for archival job (run monthly)
async def archive_old_audit_events():
    cutoff_date = datetime.now(UTC) - timedelta(days=365)

    # Export to Parquet
    events = await db.query(
        AuditEvent
    ).filter(
        AuditEvent.created_at < cutoff_date
    ).all()

    # Write to S3/MinIO
    parquet_file = export_to_parquet(events)
    s3_client.upload_file(
        parquet_file,
        bucket="pazpaz-audit-archive",
        key=f"audit_events/{cutoff_date.year}/{cutoff_date.month}.parquet"
    )

    # Verify upload
    # Delete from primary database (if using partitions, drop partition)
```

---

## Performance Considerations

### High-Volume Logging

**Expected Load**: 10,000+ events/day per workspace

#### Write Performance
- **Target**: <10ms p95 for INSERT
- **Optimization**: Batch inserts for non-critical events
- **Connection Pooling**: Dedicated pool for audit writes

```python
# Batch insert for performance
async def log_audit_events_batch(events: list[dict]):
    async with db.session() as session:
        await session.execute(
            insert(AuditEvent),
            events  # Bulk insert
        )
        await session.commit()
```

#### Read Performance
- **Target**: <50ms p95 for timeline queries
- **Target**: <100ms p95 for complex queries
- **Optimization**: Partial indexes, query result caching

#### Index Maintenance
- **Auto-vacuum**: Enabled (PostgreSQL default)
- **Manual VACUUM**: Run weekly on high-write tables
- **ANALYZE**: Run after bulk inserts

```sql
-- Maintenance commands (run weekly)
VACUUM ANALYZE audit_events;
REINDEX TABLE CONCURRENTLY audit_events;
```

### Query Optimization Tips

1. **Always filter by workspace_id**: Ensures index usage
2. **Use date range limits**: Prevents full table scans
3. **Leverage partial indexes**: Use `action = 'READ'` for PHI queries
4. **Limit result sets**: Paginate large result sets
5. **Cache frequent queries**: Redis cache for compliance reports

---

## Security and Compliance

### Immutability Guarantees

**Database Triggers** prevent tampering:

```sql
-- Prevent UPDATE
CREATE TRIGGER prevent_audit_event_update
BEFORE UPDATE ON audit_events
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION prevent_audit_event_modification();

-- Prevent DELETE
CREATE TRIGGER prevent_audit_event_delete
BEFORE DELETE ON audit_events
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION prevent_audit_event_modification();
```

**Result**: Any attempt to modify audit events raises an exception.

### PII/PHI Protection

**CRITICAL RULE**: Never store PII/PHI in audit events.

**Allowed**:
- User ID, Client ID, Session ID (references only)
- Changed field names: `["email", "phone"]`
- IP addresses (not considered PII under HIPAA)

**Forbidden**:
- Actual email addresses or phone numbers
- Client names or medical information
- Session note content
- Any identifiable health information

### Access Control

**Who can access audit logs?**
- Workspace owners (full access to their workspace)
- Compliance officers (read-only, all workspaces)
- System administrators (read-only for troubleshooting)

**How?**
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- All queries must filter by `workspace_id`
- Audit log access is itself logged (meta-audit)

### HIPAA Compliance Checklist

✅ **Audit Controls** (§164.312(b))

- [x] Timestamps with timezone
- [x] User identification (user_id)

✅ **Information System Activity Review** (§164.308(a)(1)(ii)(D))

## Example Audit Queries

### Compliance Report: PHI Access Last 30 Days

```sql
SELECT
    DATE(ae.created_at) as access_date,
    ae.resource_type,
    COUNT(*) as access_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ae.user_id) as unique_users,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ae.resource_id) as unique_resources
FROM audit_events ae
WHERE ae.workspace_id = :workspace_id
  AND ae.action = 'READ'
  AND ae.resource_type IN ('Client', 'Session', 'PlanOfCare')
  AND ae.created_at >= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY DATE(ae.created_at), ae.resource_type
ORDER BY access_date DESC, resource_type;
```

### Security Alert: Failed Login Pattern

```sql
SELECT
    ae.ip_address,
    COUNT(*) as failed_attempts,
    MIN(ae.created_at) as first_attempt,
    MAX(ae.created_at) as last_attempt
FROM audit_events ae
WHERE ae.workspace_id = :workspace_id
  AND ae.event_type = 'user.login.failed'
  AND ae.created_at >= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY ae.ip_address
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5
ORDER BY failed_attempts DESC;
```

### Data Export Audit

```sql
SELECT
    ae.created_at,
    u.full_name,
    ae.event_type,
    ae.metadata->>'format' as export_format,
    ae.metadata->>'record_count' as records_exported
FROM audit_events ae
LEFT JOIN users u ON ae.user_id = u.id
WHERE ae.workspace_id = :workspace_id
  AND ae.action = 'EXPORT'
ORDER BY ae.created_at DESC;
```

## Migration Testing

### Test Migration Upgrade

```bash
# Apply migration
uv run alembic upgrade head

# Verify table exists
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "\d audit_events"

# Verify triggers exist
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "\d+ audit_events"
```

### Test Immutability

```sql
-- Insert test event
INSERT INTO audit_events (workspace_id, event_type, action, created_at)
VALUES (
    'a0eebc99-9c0b-4ef8-bb6d-6bb9bd380a11',
    'test.event',
    'CREATE',
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
) RETURNING id;

-- Try to update (should fail)
UPDATE audit_events
SET event_type = 'modified.event'
WHERE id = '<inserted_id>';
-- Expected: ERROR: Audit events are immutable and cannot be updated

-- Try to delete (should fail)
DELETE FROM audit_events WHERE id = '<inserted_id>';
-- Expected: ERROR: Audit events are immutable and cannot be deleted
```

### Test Migration Downgrade

```bash
# Rollback migration
uv run alembic downgrade -1

# Verify table dropped
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "\d audit_events"
# Expected: Did not find any relation named "audit_events"
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Log PHI Access
```python
# After reading client data
await create_audit_event(
    workspace_id=client.workspace_id,
    user_id=current_user.id,
    event_type="client.view",
    resource_type="Client",
    resource_id=client.id,
    action=AuditAction.READ,
    ip_address=request.client.host,
    user_agent=request.headers.get("User-Agent"),
)
```

### 2. Include Meaningful Metadata
```python
# Log what changed (not the actual values if PII/PHI)
await create_audit_event(
    # ... other fields
    metadata={
        "changed_fields": ["email", "phone"],
        "reason": "client_requested_update",
    }
)
```

### 3. Use Batch Logging for Performance
```python
# Collect events during request processing
events_to_log = []
# ... process request
events_to_log.append({...})

# Batch insert after response sent (background task)
await log_audit_events_batch(events_to_log)
```

### 4. Monitor Audit Log Growth
```sql
-- Check table size
SELECT
    pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size('audit_events')) as total_size,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size('audit_events')) as table_size,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_indexes_size('audit_events')) as indexes_size;

-- Check event count by month
SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at) as month,
    COUNT(*) as event_count
FROM audit_events
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month DESC;
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Slow Queries

**Symptom**: Audit queries taking >1 second

**Diagnosis**:
```sql
-- Check if indexes are being used
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM audit_events
WHERE workspace_id = '...'
  AND created_at >= '2024-01-01'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure `workspace_id` is in WHERE clause
2. Add date range limits
3. Run VACUUM ANALYZE
4. Consider table partitioning

### High Write Volume

**Symptom**: INSERT latency increasing

**Solutions**:
1. Batch inserts (100-1000 events per batch)
2. Use async background tasks for non-critical events
3. Increase connection pool size
4. Monitor PostgreSQL write performance

### Storage Growth

**Symptom**: audit_events table >100 GB

**Solutions**:
1. Implement archival strategy (move to S3 after 1 year)
2. Enable table partitioning
3. Drop old partitions after archival
4. Compress archived data (Parquet format)
