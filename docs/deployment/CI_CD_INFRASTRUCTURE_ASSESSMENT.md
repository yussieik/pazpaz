# PazPaz CI/CD Infrastructure Assessment Report

**Assessment Date:** October 28, 2025
**Assessed By:** DevOps Infrastructure Specialist
**System:** PazPaz - HIPAA-compliant Practice Management System
**Production URL:** https://pazpaz.health

## Executive Summary

The PazPaz infrastructure demonstrates a **mature, production-ready CI/CD pipeline** with strong security posture and HIPAA compliance. The system is **fully deployed and operational** with automated testing, containerization, and deployment processes. While the core infrastructure is solid, there are opportunities for improvement in monitoring, observability, and deployment automation.

**Overall Grade: B+ (85/100)**

### Key Strengths
- ✅ **Comprehensive CI pipeline** with multi-stage quality gates
- ✅ **Security-first approach** with vulnerability scanning and HIPAA compliance
- ✅ **Production-ready containerization** with proper health checks
- ✅ **Zero-downtime deployment** capability via Docker Compose
- ✅ **Let's Encrypt SSL** with auto-renewal configured

### Areas for Improvement
- ⚠️ Manual deployment process (SSH-based, not fully automated)
- ⚠️ Limited monitoring and observability tools
- ⚠️ No staging environment for pre-production testing
- ⚠️ Backup automation not yet implemented
- ⚠️ Some container health checks need tuning

---

## 1. CI/CD Pipeline State

### Backend CI Pipeline (`.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml`)

**Status:** ✅ **Excellent** - Comprehensive and well-structured

**Pipeline Stages:**
1. **Test & Quality Checks** (20 min timeout)
   - Python 3.13.5 with uv package manager
   - PostgreSQL 16 + Redis 7 service containers
   - Ruff formatting and linting
   - MyPy type checking (non-blocking)
   - Pytest with 35% coverage requirement
   - 90% pass rate threshold

2. **Security Scanning** (15 min timeout)
   - Trivy vulnerability scanner (filesystem + Docker)
   - CodeQL security analysis
   - Safety dependency audit
   - pip-audit vulnerability check
   - SARIF uploads to GitHub Security tab

3. **OpenAPI Validation** (10 min timeout)
   - Automatic spec generation
   - Schema validation
   - Breaking change detection

4. **Docker Build & Push** (30 min timeout)
   - Multi-stage Dockerfile with security hardening
   - Non-root user execution (pazpaz:pazpaz)
   - GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)
   - Buildx with layer caching
   - Platform: linux/amd64

5. **Production Deployment** (15 min timeout)
   - Triggers on main branch push
   - SSH-based deployment to 5.161.241.81
   - Database migrations with Alembic
   - Health check verification
   - ARQ worker validation

**Recent Success Rate:** 70% (7/10 successful runs in last 2 days)

### Frontend CI Pipeline (`.github/workflows/frontend-ci.yml`)

**Status:** ✅ **Good** - Functional with quality checks relaxed

**Pipeline Stages:**
1. **Test & Quality**
   - ESLint + Prettier (non-blocking)
   - TypeScript checking (blocking)
   - Vitest unit tests (non-blocking)
   - Production build verification

2. **Security Scanning**
   - npm audit for vulnerabilities
   - Trivy filesystem scanning
   - License compliance checks

3. **Bundle Analysis** (PR only)
   - Size comparison with base branch
   - Warning on >10% increase

4. **Docker Build & Push**
   - Similar to backend pipeline
   - ghcr.io/yussieik/pazpaz-frontend

**Note:** Quality checks are temporarily relaxed to allow deployment while fixing technical debt.

### Deployment Workflow (`deploy-production.yml`)

**Status:** ⚠️ **Configured but not active** - Comprehensive but requires manual trigger

**Features:**
- Environment protection with approval gates
- Pre-deployment validation
- Docker image verification
- SSH-based deployment with health checks
- Rollback capability
- Notification support (Slack/Sentry)

**Issue:** Workflow depends on GitHub Secrets not yet configured (SSH_PRIVATE_KEY, SSH_HOST, etc.)

## 2. Resource Management

### Docker Image Management

**Status:** ✅ **Excellent**

**Backend Image (`ghcr.io/yussieik/pazpaz-backend`):**
- **Build Strategy:** Multi-stage with builder, security-scanner, runtime stages
- **Base Image:** python:3.13.5-slim (minimal attack surface)
- **Security:** Non-root user, read-only filesystem capable
- **Size:** Optimized with only runtime dependencies
- **Caching:** GitHub Actions cache + Docker layer cache
- **Tags:** latest, sha-{commit}, branch names

**Frontend Image (`ghcr.io/yussieik/pazpaz-frontend`):**
- **Build Strategy:** Multi-stage Node.js build
- **Production:** Static files baked into nginx image
- **Security:** Non-root nginx user
- **Optimization:** Production build with minification

### Container Orchestration

**Status:** ✅ **Very Good**

**Docker Compose Configuration (`docker-compose.prod.yml`):**

- **Networks:** 4 isolated networks (frontend, backend, database, internet)
- **Volumes:** 10 named volumes with proper labels
- **Resource Limits:** CPU and memory constraints defined
- **Health Checks:** All services have health checks (2 need tuning)
- **Restart Policy:** unless-stopped for all services

**Network Architecture:**
```
Internet → nginx (80/443) → frontend (internal)
                         ↘ api (internal) → database (internal)
                                         ↘ redis (internal)
                                         ↘ minio (internal)
```

### Resource Allocation

**Server:** Hetzner CPX41 (8 vCPU, 16GB RAM, 160GB NVMe)

**Container Limits:**
