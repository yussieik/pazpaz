## Major Changes

### 1. AWS Secrets Manager Documentation Consolidation

**Problem Identified:**
- **3 separate documents** covering AWS Secrets Manager with overlapping/duplicate content:
  1. `/docs/deployment/AWS_SECRETS_MANAGER_SETUP.md` (901 lines) - General setup
  2. `/docs/backend/database/AWS_SECRETS_MANAGER_DB_CREDENTIALS.md` (427 lines) - Database-specific
  3. `/docs/backend/storage/S3_CREDENTIAL_MANAGEMENT.md` (1,407 lines) - Storage-specific (includes AWS SM)

**Solution:**
- ✅ **Created** `/docs/deployment/AWS_SECRETS_MANAGER.md` (consolidated, comprehensive guide)
- ✅ **Deleted** `/docs/deployment/AWS_SECRETS_MANAGER_SETUP.md`
- ✅ **Deleted** `/docs/backend/database/AWS_SECRETS_MANAGER_DB_CREDENTIALS.md`
- ✅ **Kept** `/docs/backend/storage/S3_CREDENTIAL_MANAGEMENT.md` (different scope - MinIO/S3 credential rotation procedures, not AWS Secrets Manager setup)

**New Consolidated Document:**

**File:** `/docs/deployment/AWS_SECRETS_MANAGER.md`
**Length:** ~600 lines
**Sections:**
1. Overview & Security Benefits
2. Prerequisites
3. Secrets Reference (6 production secrets)
4. Setup Instructions (encryption key, JWT, database, Redis, S3, email)
5. IAM Permissions (task role policies)
6. Multi-Region Replication (disaster recovery)
7. Automatic Rotation (JWT, database, versioning for encryption keys)
8. Application Integration
9. Monitoring & Alerts (CloudWatch, CloudTrail)
10. Troubleshooting (4 common errors)
11. HIPAA Compliance mapping
12. References

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Single source of truth** for AWS Secrets Manager configuration
- ✅ **Complete coverage** - All secrets in one document
- ✅ **Production-ready** - Copy-paste commands that work
- ✅ **HIPAA compliance** - Mapping to specific requirements
- ✅ **Disaster recovery** - Multi-region replication guide
- ✅ **Monitoring** - CloudWatch alarms and CloudTrail audit logging

---

### 2. Obsolete Implementation Summaries

**Problem Identified:**
- "WEEK X DAY Y" implementation summaries are obsolete once implementation is complete
- Example: `WEEK3_DAY11_STORAGE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` (671 lines)

**Solution:**
- ⚠️ **Attempted deletion** but file was already removed
- ✅ **Recommendation:** Delete all `WEEK*_DAY*_*_SUMMARY.md` files after implementation complete

**Rationale:**
- Implementation summaries are useful during development
- After implementation, they become stale and duplicate information in permanent docs
- Storage configuration is now documented in `STORAGE_CONFIGURATION.md`

---

### 3. Documentation References Updated

**Files Updated:**
1. ✅ `/docs/deployment/PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`
   - Updated AWS Secrets Manager reference: `AWS_SECRETS_MANAGER_SETUP.md` → `AWS_SECRETS_MANAGER.md`

2. ✅ `/docs/backend/storage/FILE_UPLOAD_SECURITY.md`
   - Updated references section with absolute paths
   - Added link to new consolidated AWS Secrets Manager guide

3. ✅ `/docker-compose.yml`
   - Updated S3 credential management reference path: `backend/docs/storage/...` → `docs/backend/storage/...`

4. ✅ `/docs/deployment/README.md`
   - Complete rewrite with production-ready status
   - Added 144-item deployment checklist summary
   - Added quick reference commands for secret management and IAM roles
   - Added deployment timeline

5. ✅ `/docs/operations/README.md`
   - Complete rewrite with operational procedures
   - Added key rotation schedules
   - Added database maintenance procedures
   - Added incident response 5-step process with severity levels
   - Added common operational tasks (health checks, log viewing, rollback)
   - Added monitoring metrics and alert thresholds

---

## Verification Against Code

### Docker Compose Configuration

**File:** `/docker-compose.yml`

**Verified:**
- ✅ PostgreSQL service configured with SSL certificates
- ✅ Redis service with password authentication
- ✅ MinIO service with encryption key (SSE-S3 with KMS)
- ✅ ClamAV service with health checks
- ✅ All services bound to `127.0.0.1` (localhost only) for development
- ✅ Resource limits configured for all services
- ✅ Health checks configured with proper timeouts and retries
- ✅ Security warnings in comments for default credentials

**Documentation Alignment:**
- ✅ Deployment docs accurately reflect docker-compose configuration
- ✅ Infrastructure security checklist matches actual setup
- ✅ Credential management guide references correct paths

**No Issues Found:** Documentation is accurate and up-to-date with docker-compose.yml
