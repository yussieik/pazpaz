# localStorage Encryption Manual Verification Guide

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-12
**Purpose:** Manual browser verification of encrypted SOAP notes localStorage backup
**Security Classification:** Critical - PHI Protection

---

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for manually verifying that the frontend localStorage encryption implementation correctly protects PHI (Protected Health Information) in SOAP session notes. The encryption uses Web Crypto API with AES-256-GCM and cannot be fully verified through automated testing due to browser environment constraints.

**Why Manual Verification is Required:**
- Web Crypto API operates in browser environment only
- localStorage inspection requires DevTools access
- Human verification needed to confirm NO plaintext PHI visible
- HIPAA compliance requires visual confirmation of encrypted storage

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting verification:

- [ ] Development environment running (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] Backend API running (`uv run uvicorn main:app`)
- [ ] Valid JWT authentication token (logged in as therapist)
- [ ] At least one client with a SOAP session created
- [ ] Google Chrome or Firefox DevTools access

**Test Environment:**
- Browser: Chrome 120+ or Firefox 120+
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend: http://localhost:8000

---

## Security Properties to Verify

### Expected Encryption Implementation

**Algorithm:** AES-256-GCM (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data)
**Key Derivation:** PBKDF2 (100,000 iterations, SHA-256)
**Key Material:** JWT access token (first 32 characters)
**IV:** Random 12-byte initialization vector (unique per encryption)
**TTL:** 24-hour expiration on all encrypted backups
**Logout:** Automatic clearing of all session backups

### localStorage Data Structure

**Expected format for `session_<id>_backup` keys:**

```json
{
  "encrypted_data": "base64_ciphertext_string",
  "iv": "base64_initialization_vector",
  "timestamp": 1697123456789,
  "version": 1
}
```

**Security Requirements:**
- NO plaintext PHI visible in `encrypted_data` field
- `iv` must be random (different for each backup)
- `timestamp` must be within 24 hours for active backups
- `version` must match session version for optimistic locking

---

## Test 1: Encryption Verification (CRITICAL)

**Objective:** Confirm that PHI is encrypted and NOT stored in plaintext

### Steps:

1. **Open Session Editor**
   - Navigate to any client detail page
   - Click on an existing session or create a new one
   - Session editor should be visible with SOAP fields

2. **Enter PHI Content**
   - Type realistic PHI into Subjective field:
     ```
     Patient reports severe shoulder pain radiating down left arm.
     Pain started 3 days ago after lifting heavy boxes.
     Patient rates pain as 8/10.
     ```
   - Type into Objective field:
     ```
     ROM: Shoulder abduction 120°, flexion 130° (limited)
     Palpation reveals tenderness at supraspinatus insertion
     Moderate swelling noted
     ```

3. **Wait for Autosave**
   - Wait 5 seconds for autosave to trigger
   - Verify "Saved X seconds ago" indicator appears

4. **Open DevTools**
   - Press `F12` or `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac)
   - Navigate to **Application** tab (Chrome) or **Storage** tab (Firefox)
   - Expand **Local Storage** in left sidebar
   - Click on `http://localhost:5173`

5. **Locate Encrypted Backup**
   - Find key matching pattern: `session_<uuid>_backup`
   - Example: `session_550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000_backup`
   - Click on the key to view its value

6. **Verify Data Structure**
   - Confirm value is valid JSON with 4 fields:
     - `encrypted_data` (long base64 string)
     - `iv` (shorter base64 string, ~16 characters)
     - `timestamp` (Unix timestamp in milliseconds)
     - `version` (integer)

7. **Verify Encryption (CRITICAL CHECK)**
   - **Expand the `encrypted_data` field**
   - **Visually scan the entire base64 string**
   - **Confirm NONE of the following plaintext phrases appear:**
     - "shoulder pain"
     - "left arm"
     - "lifting heavy"
     - "ROM"
     - "supraspinatus"
     - "Palpation"
     - Any other text you typed

8. **Expected Result:**
   - `encrypted_data` should look like random base64:
     ```
     "ZXhhbXBsZV9lbmNyeXB0ZWRfY2lwaGVydGV4dF93aXRoX3JhbmRvbV9ieXRlcw=="
     ```
   - NO readable English words
   - NO recognizable patterns from SOAP notes
   - Length should be ~150-300% of plaintext length (overhead from encryption)

### Pass Criteria:

- [ ] `session_*_backup` key exists in localStorage
- [ ] JSON structure has all 4 required fields
- [ ] `encrypted_data` is base64-encoded (only alphanumeric + `/` `+` `=`)
- [ ] **ZERO plaintext PHI visible in encrypted data**
- [ ] `iv` field exists and is ~16 characters
- [ ] `timestamp` is recent (within last few minutes)
- [ ] `version` matches session version (usually 1 for new session)

### Fail Criteria (CRITICAL - DO NOT DEPLOY):

- ❌ Any plaintext PHI visible in localStorage value
- ❌ SOAP note content readable in `encrypted_data`
- ❌ Missing `iv` or `timestamp` fields
- ❌ `encrypted_data` is empty or null

---

## Test 2: IV Randomization (HIGH)

**Objective:** Verify that each encryption uses a unique random IV

### Steps:

1. **Create First Backup**
   - Type "Test content 1" in Subjective field
   - Wait 5 seconds for autosave
   - Open DevTools → Local Storage
   - Copy the `iv` value for `session_*_backup` key
   - Example: `iv: "A1B2C3D4E5F6G7H8"`

2. **Modify Content**
   - Change Subjective to "Test content 2"
   - Wait 5 seconds for autosave

3. **Check New IV**
   - Refresh DevTools Local Storage view
   - Compare new `iv` value with previous one

4. **Expected Result:**
   - IVs should be DIFFERENT (new random IV generated)
   - `encrypted_data` should also be different (even for same content)

### Pass Criteria:

- [ ] First encryption creates valid `iv` field
- [ ] Second encryption creates DIFFERENT `iv` value
- [ ] Both IVs are ~16 characters base64-encoded
- [ ] `encrypted_data` changes between encryptions

### Fail Criteria:

- ❌ IV value is reused between encryptions
- ❌ IV is empty or constant across multiple saves
- ❌ Same content produces identical `encrypted_data` (IV not being used)

---

## Test 3: Decryption with Valid JWT (MEDIUM)

**Objective:** Verify backup can be decrypted and restored with valid JWT

### Steps:

1. **Create Encrypted Backup**
   - Type "Original content for restore test" in Subjective
   - Wait 5 seconds for autosave
   - Verify backup exists in localStorage

2. **Hard Reload Page**
   - Press `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)
   - This simulates returning to session after browser close

3. **Check for Restore Prompt**
   - If local backup is NEWER than server version:
     - Modal should appear: "Restore Unsaved Changes?"
     - Click "Restore Changes"
   - If server version is newer:
     - No prompt should appear (expected behavior)
     - Backend data is authoritative

4. **Verify Decryption**
   - Content should be restored to editor fields
   - Verify "Original content for restore test" appears in Subjective

### Pass Criteria:

- [ ] Restore prompt appears when local backup is newer
- [ ] "Restore Changes" button successfully decrypts backup
- [ ] All SOAP fields restored with correct content
- [ ] No decryption errors in browser console

### Fail Criteria:

- ❌ Decryption fails with valid JWT
- ❌ Content not restored or corrupted
- ❌ Console errors about encryption/decryption

---

## Test 4: Decryption Failure without JWT (HIGH)

**Objective:** Verify backup cannot be decrypted without valid JWT (security control)

### Steps:

1. **Create Encrypted Backup**
   - Type "Secret PHI content" in Subjective
   - Wait 5 seconds for autosave
   - Verify backup exists in localStorage

2. **Clear JWT Token**
   - Open DevTools → Application → Cookies
   - Find `access_token` cookie
   - Delete the cookie (simulates logout or expired token)

3. **Reload Page**
   - Press `F5` or `Cmd+R`
   - Page will redirect to login (no JWT)

4. **Check localStorage**
   - DevTools → Application → Local Storage
   - Verify `session_*_backup` key is DELETED

5. **Expected Result:**
   - Backup should be automatically deleted (graceful failure)
   - No error modal shown to user
   - Console may show info message about missing JWT

### Pass Criteria:

- [ ] Backup deleted when JWT is missing
- [ ] No restore prompt appears
- [ ] No error messages shown to user
- [ ] Console logs informational message (not error)

### Fail Criteria:

- ❌ Backup remains in localStorage without JWT
- ❌ Application crashes or shows error modal
- ❌ Plaintext content accessible without JWT

---

## Test 5: 24-Hour TTL Enforcement (MEDIUM)

**Objective:** Verify expired backups are automatically deleted

### Steps:

1. **Create Fresh Backup**
   - Type "TTL test content" in Subjective
   - Wait 5 seconds for autosave
   - Verify backup exists in localStorage

2. **Manually Expire Backup**
   - Open DevTools → Console
   - Run the following JavaScript:
     ```javascript
     // Find the session backup key
     const keys = Object.keys(localStorage);
     const backupKey = keys.find(k => k.startsWith('session_') && k.endsWith('_backup'));

     // Parse and modify timestamp to 25 hours ago
     const backup = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(backupKey));
     backup.timestamp = Date.now() - (25 * 60 * 60 * 1000); // 25 hours ago
     localStorage.setItem(backupKey, JSON.stringify(backup));

     console.log('Backup expired:', backup.timestamp);
     ```

3. **Reload Page**
   - Press `F5` or `Cmd+R`

4. **Check localStorage**
   - DevTools → Application → Local Storage
   - Verify expired backup is DELETED

5. **Expected Result:**
   - Expired backup automatically removed
   - No restore prompt appears
   - Console logs expiration message

### Pass Criteria:

- [ ] Backup with timestamp > 24 hours ago is deleted
- [ ] Backup with timestamp < 24 hours remains
- [ ] No restore prompt for expired backups
- [ ] Console shows expiration info message

### Fail Criteria:

- ❌ Expired backup remains in localStorage
- ❌ Restore prompt appears for expired backup
- ❌ Application attempts to decrypt expired data

---

## Test 6: Logout Clearing (CRITICAL)

**Objective:** Verify ALL session backups are deleted on logout (HIPAA requirement)

### Steps:

1. **Create Multiple Session Backups**
   - Open 3 different SOAP sessions (3 clients or 3 sessions for same client)
   - Edit each session (type different content in each)
   - Wait 5 seconds for autosave on each
   - Verify 3 `session_*_backup` keys exist in localStorage

2. **Count Backups**
   - DevTools → Application → Local Storage
   - Count keys matching `session_*_backup` pattern
   - Should be 3 keys

3. **Logout**
   - Click "Logout" button in application
   - OR run in console: `useAuthStore().logout()`

4. **Verify All Backups Deleted**
   - DevTools → Application → Local Storage
   - Confirm ZERO `session_*_backup` keys remain

5. **Expected Result:**
   - All encrypted backups cleared
   - User redirected to login page
   - localStorage only contains non-sensitive keys (e.g., theme, language)

### Pass Criteria:

- [ ] All `session_*_backup` keys deleted on logout
- [ ] Console shows info message: "Cleared N backup(s) on logout"
- [ ] User redirected to login page
- [ ] JWT cookie deleted

### Fail Criteria (CRITICAL - HIPAA VIOLATION):

- ❌ Any `session_*_backup` keys remain after logout
- ❌ Logout fails to clear backups
- ❌ Encrypted PHI accessible after logout on shared computer

---

## Test 7: Key Rotation with JWT (MEDIUM)

**Objective:** Verify old backups cannot be decrypted after JWT rotation

### Steps:

1. **Create Backup with Current JWT**
   - Type "Content with JWT v1" in Subjective
   - Wait 5 seconds for autosave
   - Copy the `encrypted_data` value from DevTools

2. **Simulate JWT Rotation**
   - This test requires backend support (JWT re-issue)
   - Option A: Wait 7 days for natural JWT expiration (impractical)
   - Option B: Re-login to get new JWT:
     - Logout
     - Login again
     - New JWT issued with different key material

3. **Check Old Backup**
   - Navigate to same session
   - Old backup should fail to decrypt
   - Backup should be deleted (graceful failure)

4. **Expected Result:**
   - Old backup with old JWT key cannot be decrypted
   - Backup automatically deleted
   - No error shown to user

### Pass Criteria:

- [ ] Backup created with old JWT cannot be decrypted with new JWT
- [ ] Old backup automatically deleted on decryption failure
- [ ] User can create new backup with new JWT

### Fail Criteria:

- ❌ Old backups remain decryptable with new JWT (key rotation not working)
- ❌ Application crashes on decryption failure

**Note:** This test verifies key rotation security (intentional incompatibility between JWT generations).

## Test 8: Tampering Detection (HIGH)

**Objective:** Verify GCM authentication tag detects tampering

### Steps:

1. **Create Valid Backup**
   - Type "Original authentic content" in Subjective
   - Wait 5 seconds for autosave
   - DevTools → Local Storage → copy backup value

2. **Tamper with Encrypted Data**
   - Open DevTools → Console
   - Run JavaScript to modify ciphertext:
     ```javascript
     const key = Object.keys(localStorage).find(k => k.startsWith('session_') && k.endsWith('_backup'));
     const backup = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(key));

     // Flip a bit in the encrypted data (simulate tampering)
     const tampered = backup.encrypted_data.slice(0, -5) + 'XXXXX';
     backup.encrypted_data = tampered;

     localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(backup));
     console.log('Backup tampered');
     ```

3. **Reload Page**
   - Press `F5` or `Cmd+R`

4. **Expected Result:**
   - Decryption fails (GCM authentication tag mismatch)
   - Backup automatically deleted
   - No restore prompt appears
   - Console logs decryption error

5. **Verify No Error Modal**
   - User should NOT see error message
   - Graceful failure (silent cleanup)

### Pass Criteria:

- [ ] Tampered backup fails to decrypt
- [ ] Tampered backup automatically deleted
- [ ] No error modal shown to user
- [ ] Console logs decryption failure

### Fail Criteria:

- ❌ Tampered data decrypts successfully (GCM not validating)
- ❌ Corrupted data loaded into editor
- ❌ Application crashes with unhandled error

---

## Test 9: Browser Extension Security (INFORMATIONAL)

**Objective:** Verify that browser extensions cannot easily access encrypted data

### Steps:

1. **Install a localStorage Inspector Extension**
   - Example: "Storage Area Explorer" (Chrome Web Store)
   - OR use built-in DevTools

2. **View localStorage through Extension**
   - Open extension's localStorage viewer
   - Locate `session_*_backup` keys

3. **Confirm Encryption**
   - Extension should show encrypted JSON structure
   - NO plaintext PHI visible through extension UI
   - Extension would need JWT token AND decryption code to access PHI

4. **Expected Result:**
   - Extensions see encrypted data (same as DevTools)
   - Encryption provides defense-in-depth against malicious extensions

### Pass Criteria:

- [ ] Browser extensions see same encrypted JSON as DevTools
- [ ] No plaintext PHI accessible through extension UI

**Note:** This is informational only. Extensions with malicious intent CAN access JWT cookies and potentially decrypt data. Encryption protects against:
- Passive extensions (read-only)
- Non-technical users inspecting localStorage
- Deleted backups after logout (old data unrecoverable)

---

## Test 10: Offline Mode Verification (MEDIUM)

**Objective:** Verify backups work when offline

### Steps:

1. **Go Offline**
   - DevTools → Network tab → Enable "Offline" throttling
   - OR disconnect from network

2. **Edit Session**
   - Type "Offline edit test" in Subjective
   - Wait 5 seconds

3. **Verify Local Backup Created**
   - DevTools → Application → Local Storage
   - Confirm `session_*_backup` exists with new timestamp

4. **Check Offline Indicator**
   - UI should show "Offline - Changes saved locally" badge

5. **Go Back Online**
   - DevTools → Network → Disable "Offline"
   - OR reconnect to network

6. **Verify Auto-Sync**
   - Application should detect online status
   - Auto-sync backup to server
   - Backup should be deleted after successful sync

### Pass Criteria:

- [ ] Backup created successfully while offline
- [ ] Offline indicator appears in UI
- [ ] Auto-sync occurs when back online
- [ ] Backup deleted after successful sync

### Fail Criteria:

- ❌ No backup created when offline
- ❌ Data lost when going offline
- ❌ Auto-sync fails or backup remains after sync

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No `session_*_backup` key appears in localStorage

**Possible Causes:**
- Autosave not triggering (wait full 5 seconds)
- JWT token missing (check cookies)
- Encryption error (check console for errors)
- Session not in draft mode (finalized sessions may not backup)

**Solution:**
- Verify JWT cookie exists: `document.cookie.includes('access_token')`
- Check console for encryption errors
- Verify session is draft: `is_draft: true`

### Issue: Plaintext PHI visible in localStorage

**Severity:** CRITICAL - DO NOT DEPLOY

**Possible Causes:**
- Encryption not implemented
- Fallback to plaintext storage
- Encryption code not running

**Solution:**
- Review `/src/composables/useSecureOfflineBackup.ts` implementation
- Verify `backupDraft()` is called with correct parameters
- Check browser console for encryption errors
- Contact security team IMMEDIATELY

### Issue: Restore prompt not appearing

**Possible Causes:**
- Server version is newer than local backup (expected)
- Backup expired (> 24 hours old)
- JWT changed (backup encrypted with different key)

**Solution:**
- This is expected behavior (server is source of truth)
- Only prompts if local backup is NEWER than server

### Issue: Backup not deleted on logout

**Severity:** CRITICAL - HIPAA VIOLATION

**Possible Causes:**
- `clearAllBackups()` not called in logout flow
- localStorage API error
- Logout process incomplete

**Solution:**
- Verify `auth.ts` calls `clearAllBackups()` on logout
- Check console for errors during logout
- Manually clear: `localStorage.clear()` (workaround)
- Contact security team
