"""arq worker scheduler for PazPaz notification system.

This module defines the arq WorkerSettings class that configures the background
worker for scheduled notification tasks. The worker handles:

    - Session notes reminders (daily, at user-specified times)
    - Daily appointment digests (morning summaries)
    - Appointment reminders (15min, 30min, 1hr, 2hr, 24hr before appointments)

The worker runs scheduled jobs using cron-like syntax and connects to Redis
for job queue management. All jobs are initially empty and will be implemented
in subsequent phases.

Architecture:
    - arq uses Redis as both job queue and result backend
    - Worker processes run independently of the FastAPI application
    - Jobs are scheduled using cron expressions (timezone-aware)
    - Failed jobs are retried with exponential backoff

Usage:
    Start the worker from the command line:

        $ cd backend
        $ PYTHONPATH=src uv run arq pazpaz.workers.scheduler.WorkerSettings

    Or via Docker Compose:

        services:
          arq-worker:
            build: ./backend
            command: arq pazpaz.workers.scheduler.WorkerSettings
