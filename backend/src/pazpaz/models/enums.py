"""Payment-related enumerations.

This module defines enums for payment tracking in appointments.
These enums provide type safety and validation for payment-related fields.

Usage:
    from pazpaz.models.enums import PaymentStatus, PaymentMethod

    # In Pydantic schemas
    class AppointmentCreate(BaseModel):
        payment_status: PaymentStatus = PaymentStatus.NOT_PAID
        payment_method: PaymentMethod | None = None

    # In SQLAlchemy models
    payment_status: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(
        nullable=False,
        default=PaymentStatus.NOT_PAID.value
    )
"""
