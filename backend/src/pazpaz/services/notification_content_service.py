"""Notification content service - email content builders.

This service builds email subjects and bodies for different notification types.
It queries necessary data from the database and formats user-friendly messages.

Design principles:
- Clear, friendly, professional tone
- Plain text emails (HTML in future phases)
- Include relevant links to frontend
- Never expose sensitive data in subjects
- Graceful handling of missing data
