"""add_appointment_reminder_tracking

Revision ID: b9c4d5e6f7a8
Revises: a8b3c4d5e6f7
Create Date: 2025-10-22 18:30:00.000000

Adds appointment reminder tracking to prevent duplicate reminder sends.

This migration creates the appointment_reminders_sent table to track which
reminders have been sent for each appointment. When the scheduler runs
multiple times within the tolerance window (Â±2 minutes), this table ensures
each reminder type is sent only once per appointment per user.

Table: appointment_reminders_sent
- id: UUID primary key
- appointment_id: Reference to appointment (CASCADE delete)
- user_id: Reference to user who received reminder (CASCADE delete)
- reminder_type: Type of reminder ('15min', '30min', '1hr', '2hr', '24hr')
- sent_at: When reminder was sent (for cleanup queries)
- created_at: Record creation timestamp

Constraints:
- Unique constraint on (appointment_id, user_id, reminder_type) for deduplication
- Foreign keys with CASCADE delete for automatic cleanup

Indexes:
- Primary key index on id (automatic)
- Index on appointment_id for lookups
- Index on user_id for lookups
- Index on sent_at for cleanup queries
- Composite index on (appointment_id, user_id, reminder_type) for dedup checks

Cleanup Strategy:
Records older than 30 days are periodically deleted via cleanup_old_reminders()
service function to prevent table bloat.
