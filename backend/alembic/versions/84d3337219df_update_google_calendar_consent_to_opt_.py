"""update_google_calendar_consent_to_opt_out

Change Google Calendar consent model from opt-in to opt-out for better UX.

Legal rationale: Appointment reminders fall under "Healthcare Operations"
(HIPAA ยง164.506), so opt-out model is HIPAA-compliant and provides better UX.

Changes:
1. Set server default to TRUE (new clients consent by default)
2. Update existing NULL values to TRUE (assume consent for existing clients)
3. Set google_calendar_consent_date for migrated clients

    # NOTE: We do NOT revert existing TRUE values back to NULL

    # 2. Clients who were migrated from NULL to TRUE (could revert to NULL)
    #
    # Since this is a UX improvement and both models are HIPAA-compliant,
    # we preserve existing consent status on downgrade.
