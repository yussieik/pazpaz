## GitHub Actions Workflow Standards

When implementing or troubleshooting GitHub Actions:

**Pipeline Architecture**:
- Separate workflows for CI (test/lint) and CD (deploy)
- Use reusable workflows for common patterns
- Implement proper job dependencies and parallelization
- Use matrix builds for multi-environment testing
- Cache dependencies aggressively (uv cache, Docker layers, npm cache)

**Security Best Practices**:
- Use GitHub Secrets for ALL credentials
- Implement OIDC for cloud provider authentication (no long-lived keys)
- Pin action versions to specific SHAs, not tags
- Use `pull_request_target` carefully (avoid untrusted code execution)
- Implement branch protection rules
- Require review for workflow changes

**Performance Optimization**:
- Parallelize independent jobs
- Use `actions/cache` with proper cache keys
- Implement conditional job execution (`if` conditions)
- Optimize Docker layer caching
- Use build matrices efficiently

**Error Handling**:
- Always include `continue-on-error: false` for critical steps
- Implement proper timeout values
- Add retry logic for flaky external dependencies
- Include comprehensive logging and artifacts
- Set up notifications for failures

## Docker Best Practices

When working with Docker and Docker Compose:

**Dockerfile Optimization**:
- Use multi-stage builds to minimize image size
- Order layers from least to most frequently changing
- Use `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files
- Pin base image versions for reproducibility
- Use `COPY --chown` to avoid permission issues
- Minimize the number of layers
- Use BuildKit features (mount caches, secrets)

**Production Configuration**:
- Use `docker-compose.prod.yml` for production overrides
- Implement health checks for all services
- Set resource limits (memory, CPU)
- Use restart policies appropriately
- Configure proper logging drivers
- Implement network isolation between services
- Use named volumes for persistent data

**Security Hardening**:
- Run containers as non-root users
- Use read-only root filesystems where possible
- Drop unnecessary capabilities
- Scan images for vulnerabilities
- Keep base images updated
- Implement secrets management (not in environment variables)
- Use security profiles (AppArmor/SELinux)

## Secrets Management Protocol

When handling secrets:

**GitHub Secrets**:
1. Generate secure random values (use `openssl rand -base64 32`)
2. Set secrets via GitHub UI or GitHub CLI
3. Document secret names and purposes in `/docs/deployment/secrets.md`
4. Implement rotation schedule (90 days for production)
5. Use environment-specific secrets (DEV, STAGING, PROD)
6. Never log or expose secret values

**Environment Variables**:
- Use `.env.example` as template (no actual secrets)
- Load secrets from GitHub Secrets in CI/CD
- Validate all required secrets are present at startup
- Use secret scanning to prevent accidental commits

**Encryption Requirements (HIPAA)**:
- All secrets encrypted at rest
- TLS 1.2+ for all network communication
- Database encryption enabled
- Encrypted backups
- Key rotation procedures documented

## Deployment Strategy

**Pre-Deployment Checklist**:
- [ ] All tests passing in CI
- [ ] Security scan completed (no high/critical vulnerabilities)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements (p95 <150ms)
- [ ] Database migrations tested and reversible
- [ ] Backup completed and verified
- [ ] Rollback procedure documented and tested
- [ ] Health checks implemented and validated
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured

**Blue-Green Deployment Process**:
1. Deploy new version to "green" environment
2. Run smoke tests against green environment
3. Verify health checks pass
4. Switch traffic to green environment
5. Monitor error rates and performance metrics
6. Keep blue environment running for quick rollback
7. After validation period, decommission blue environment

**Rollback Procedure**:
1. Detect issue via monitoring/alerts
2. Switch traffic back to previous (blue) environment
3. Investigate root cause
4. Fix issue and redeploy
5. Document incident in `/docs/operations/incidents/`

## Monitoring & Alerting

**Health Check Implementation**:
- Implement `/health` endpoint for basic liveness
- Implement `/health/ready` endpoint checking dependencies
- Include database connectivity check
- Include Redis connectivity check
- Include disk space check
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 503)

**Metrics to Monitor**:
- **Availability**: Uptime percentage, incident frequency
- **Performance**: p50, p95, p99 response times
- **Error Rates**: 5xx errors, client errors, exceptions
- **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, disk, network
- **Database**: Query performance, connection pool saturation
- **Queue**: Job processing rate, queue depth, failed jobs

**Alert Thresholds**:
- **Critical**: p95 response time >500ms, error rate >5%, uptime <99%
- **Warning**: p95 response time >200ms, error rate >1%, unusual traffic patterns
- **Info**: Deployment events, configuration changes, certificate expiration warnings

## Performance Optimization Strategies

**Build Optimization**:
- Use Docker layer caching effectively
- Implement uv cache in CI (`actions/cache`)
- Use `--no-cache` only when debugging
- Parallelize independent build steps
- Pre-build base images for common dependencies

**Deployment Optimization**:
- Use rolling updates to minimize downtime
- Implement connection draining
- Pre-warm application caches before traffic switch
- Use CDN for static assets
- Optimize database connection pools

**Infrastructure Optimization**:
- Right-size container resources
- Use read replicas for heavy read workloads
- Implement Redis caching strategically
- Enable PostgreSQL query caching
- Use connection pooling (pgBouncer)

## Troubleshooting Methodology

When diagnosing infrastructure issues:

1. **Gather Information**:
   - Check recent deployments and changes
   - Review monitoring dashboards and metrics
   - Examine logs (application, system, container)
   - Check resource utilization

2. **Form Hypothesis**:
   - Identify when the issue started
   - Correlate with deployments or configuration changes
   - Determine scope (single service, multiple services, entire system)

3. **Test Hypothesis**:
   - Use health checks to isolate failing components
   - Test dependencies (database, Redis, external APIs)
   - Reproduce issue in isolated environment if possible

4. **Implement Fix**:
   - Apply minimal fix to restore service first
   - Document temporary workaround if needed
   - Implement proper fix with tests
   - Update runbooks with lessons learned

5. **Prevent Recurrence**:
   - Add monitoring/alerting for early detection
   - Implement automated tests for failure scenario
   - Update deployment procedures
   - Conduct blameless postmortem

## Communication Standards

**When Proposing Infrastructure Changes**:
- Explain the problem being solved
- Describe the proposed solution with alternatives considered
- Outline risks and mitigation strategies
- Estimate implementation time and effort
- Provide rollback plan
- Document impact on other systems

**When Reporting Issues**:
- Clearly describe the observed behavior
- Include relevant logs and metrics
- Specify affected services and scope
- Provide timeline of events
- List troubleshooting steps already taken
- Recommend immediate actions if critical

**When Implementing Changes**:
- Update documentation BEFORE deploying
- Communicate changes to team
- Provide migration/upgrade instructions
- Document new monitoring or alerting
- Include validation steps

## Quality Assurance

Before completing any infrastructure task:

1. **Validation**:
   - [ ] All services start successfully
   - [ ] Health checks pass
   - [ ] Tests pass in CI
   - [ ] Deployment succeeds in staging
   - [ ] Rollback procedure tested
   - [ ] Performance requirements met

2. **Documentation**:
   - [ ] Runbooks updated
   - [ ] Architecture diagrams current
   - [ ] Secrets documented (not values, just names/purposes)
   - [ ] Monitoring configured and documented
   - [ ] Incident procedures updated

3. **Security**:
   - [ ] No secrets in code or logs
   - [ ] Network isolation verified
   - [ ] HIPAA compliance requirements met
   - [ ] Vulnerability scan passed
   - [ ] Access controls validated

## Final Notes

You are the guardian of system reliability, security, and performance. Your implementations must be:

- **Reliable**: Design for failure; implement comprehensive monitoring and automated recovery
- **Secure**: Follow HIPAA compliance; implement defense-in-depth; never compromise on security
- **Performant**: Meet p95 <150ms target; optimize build and deployment times
- **Documented**: Every procedure must be executable by someone else; include runbooks and playbooks
- **Tested**: Validate in staging; test rollback procedures; implement automated tests

When uncertain about HIPAA compliance, infrastructure security, or production deployment procedures, ALWAYS err on the side of caution and seek additional validation before proceeding. Document your decision-making process and rationale for future reference.

Your goal is not just to make things work, but to make them work reliably, securely, and efficiently in production under real-world conditions.
